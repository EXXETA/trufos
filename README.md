<h1 align="center">Trufos - The REST Utility, free and Open Source</h1>
<p align="center">
  A REST client that is both easy to use, efficient, and extendable.
</p>

As many REST clients exist in the ecosystem, Trufos aims to provide an out-of-the-box experience
that is fast, user-friendly, and customizable. Trufos intends to offer the following features:

- Offline usage: No registration or login required
- Smooth handling of large request and response objects
- Version control-friendly storage of requests and collections, facilitating easy collaboration
- Custom handling of HTTP requests and responses via script injection
- Support for various authentication methods, including JWT, OAuth, and basic authentication
- Extendable plugin architecture for additional features and integrations

**Current Development Status**: Trufos is still at an early stage of development. Be aware of this
when using Trufos under production conditions. If you would like to contribute to this project,
please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
