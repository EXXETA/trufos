<h1 align="center">Rufus</h1>
<p align="center">
  A rest client that is both easy to use, efficient and extendable
</p>

With many other existing rest clients in the ecosphere, Rufus intends to provide an out-of-the-box
experience that is both fast, easy to use and customizable.
Additionally, Rufus aims to provide the following features:

- Offline only, no registration or logins necessary
- Smooth handling of large request and response objects
- Version control friendly storage of requests and collections, allowing easy collaboration
- Custom handling of HTTP requests and responses via custom script injection

As of right now, Rufus is still in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
