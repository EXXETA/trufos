## Requirements

As Trufos is an Electron application, it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without any issues. If
you want to develop or build this software yourself, you will need Node.js version 22. We use **yarn**
and not NPM in this project as it can better handle peer dependencies. **Do not install dependencies with NPM!**

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` to start the application in development mode

### Building the Application

1. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `yarn run make` to build the application for your platform
3. The built application will be in the `out/make` directory
   - Windows: a `Setup.exe` file
   - macOS: a `.dmg` file
   - Linux: currently a ZIP file (`.deb` file is planned)

## Usage

Once Trufos is installed and launched, you can start adding endpoints, customizing them, and making
calls.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to add and utilize an endpoint:

1. Click on "Create New Request".
2. Enter the URL.
3. Select the method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
4. Optionally, add headers and body content.
5. Click "Send Request" and review the response in the results area.

## FAQ

- Where can I find the saved Requests?
- The saved requests are in this folder:
  - Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Trufos/default-collection`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Trufos\default-collection`
