Trufos now has its own Website! ðŸŽ‰

We're using [GitHub Pages] to host our documentation, which is built using [Jekyll]. This allows us
to easily manage and update our content while providing a clean and user-friendly interface.

If you're looking for information on how to use Trufos, you can find it in the
[Getting Started]({% link getting-started.md %}).
