Trufos now has its own Website! ðŸŽ‰

We're using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host our documentation, which is built
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allows us to easily manage and update our content while
providing a clean and user-friendly interface.

If you're looking for information on how to use Trufos, you can find it in the
[Getting Started]({% link _tabs/getting-started.md %}).
